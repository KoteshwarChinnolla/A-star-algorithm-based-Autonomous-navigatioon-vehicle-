Automation is revolutionized in every field. This significantly reduces the human efforts. Recently there has been a lot of hype around autonomous vehicles. The introduction of autonomous vehicles such as Tesla has made some remarkable progress in terms of traffic management. There have also been a lot of improvements in the localisation but the only problem is the cost of implementation. Autonomous vehicles use some of the expensive sensors like lidar, Radar, and GPS. This is too expensive when it comes to small scale, like in a home, office, or industry field. We came up with a solution of being able to solve every case using a very cost-effective way. we aim to include every functionality using the programming techniques. some of them include the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes, and localisation using previously visited points which solves the case of using  GPS. For path following we are using Arduino and serial port connections.
